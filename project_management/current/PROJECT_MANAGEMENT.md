# CGKN current project management

Current project management follows the product authority in `PRODUCT_GOAL.md`, `MVP_SCOPE.md`, `governance/product_invariants.json`, and `governance/current_architecture.json`.

## Current status

The repository-reset cleanup is closed. Obsolete pre-MVP copies and
orphaned experiment families have been physically deleted from the working tree;
Git history is the archive.

This does not mean the new runtime is operational, and it does not establish
functional readiness.

The remaining compatibility runtime is intentionally retained:

- `scripts/codex_conversation.py`
- `scripts/run_codex_conversation_generation.py`
- `scripts/run_local_pipeline.py`
- `scripts/run_local_pipeline_impl.py`

Further cleanup inside that cluster now requires a working replacement path.

## Current feature increment

`ITER-053` builds a local-first promotion capability
branch over the existing Component, Registry, Runtime, validation, and evidence
boundaries. It does not add a Promotion runtime or grant Provider/connector
planning authority.

The active increment projects explicit public-safe evidence into claims, detects
promotion signals, builds campaigns and platform variants, renders local image
and video assets, and creates approval-bound publication plans and receipts.
External publication is disabled by default. Native adapters are qualified with
injected transports; a real public post remains optional and requires local test
credentials plus exact explicit approval.

## Roadmap after the active increment

1. complete CapabilityTree edit semantics;
2. complete Tree-to-DAG execution semantics;
3. add more bounded executor adapters;
4. persist project-level state and safe resume;
5. prove one real vertical slice;
6. add affected-subgraph repair;
7. add capability registry and validated self-growth;
8. add optional project-team views and later promotion capabilities.

## Management surfaces

- `backlog.json` — active and future MVP work;
- `risks.json` — current architecture and migration risks;
- `active_iteration.json` — the single active feature increment;
- `enterprise_experience.json` — reviewed reusable lessons;
- `governance/mvp_cleanup_boundary.json` — cleanup completion and migration boundary.

Management records cannot authorize functional success, formal evidence, packaging, or delivery.

## Verification

Source validation is in progress. Formal Promotion Studio evidence is not valid
until one clean canonical Source Closure passes compileall, all Kernel gates and
profiles, collection, and full pytest. Offline publisher qualification cannot
authorize a real public write.
