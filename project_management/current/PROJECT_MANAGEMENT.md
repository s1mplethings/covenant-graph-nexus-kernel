# CGKN current project management

Current project management follows the product authority in `PRODUCT_GOAL.md`, `MVP_SCOPE.md`, `governance/product_invariants.json`, and `governance/current_architecture.json`.

## Current status

The repository-reset cleanup is closed. Obsolete pre-MVP copies and
orphaned experiment families have been physically deleted from the working tree;
Git history is the archive.

This does not mean the new runtime is operational, and it does not establish
functional readiness.

The remaining compatibility runtime is intentionally retained:

- `scripts/codex_conversation.py`
- `scripts/run_codex_conversation_generation.py`
- `scripts/run_local_pipeline.py`
- `scripts/run_local_pipeline_impl.py`

Further cleanup inside that cluster now requires a working replacement path.

## Current feature increment

`ITER-PROVIDER-CONNECTION-NORMALIZATION-017` preserves the pre-normalization
Provider failures, ratchets the existing evaluation source into
`BASELINE-PROVIDER-EVAL-001`, and separates vendor connectivity from Provider
quality. Qwen, Grok, and DeepSeek receive independent bounded connectors behind
one canonical completion contract; connection, selection, repository codegen,
capability building, and self-growth retain independent readiness states.

The iteration uses a hybrid approach: stable product, budget, credential,
fallback, DAG, and admission governance surrounds incremental connector and
builder slices. A single eligible Provider may support explicitly labelled
single-provider validation, but cannot authorize adaptive selection.

## Roadmap after the active increment

1. complete CapabilityTree edit semantics;
2. complete Tree-to-DAG execution semantics;
3. add more bounded executor adapters;
4. persist project-level state and safe resume;
5. prove one real vertical slice;
6. add affected-subgraph repair;
7. add capability registry and validated self-growth;
8. add optional project-team views and later promotion capabilities.

## Management surfaces

- `backlog.json` — active and future MVP work;
- `risks.json` — current architecture and migration risks;
- `active_iteration.json` — the single active feature increment;
- `enterprise_experience.json` — reviewed reusable lessons;
- `governance/mvp_cleanup_boundary.json` — cleanup completion and migration boundary.

Management records cannot authorize functional success, formal evidence, packaging, or delivery.

## Verification

Local direction, focused, import, and collection checks pass. Full pytest
execution and GitHub Actions verification remain `NOT_EVALUATED` and cannot be
inferred from cleanup evidence.
